    <h1>The Most Amusing Web Page Ever!</h1>
    <h3>By: Owen Spooner</h3>
    <p>This page contains some sites on the internet the I find amusing.</p>

    <h2>Fail Videos</h2>
    <p>Whenever I am bored or feeling down, I always like to put on a fail compilation video. It is late night YouTube rabbit hole that I often find myself going into.</p>

    <h2>Web Browser Games</h2>
    <p>If you ever are in the mood to play a quick game of something on your web browser, Agar.io is the answer. I have many memories of playing this game with my friends when I was in middle school. I also find this game to be extremley satisfying.</p>

    <h2>View the World</h2>
    <p>I have always been amused by geography. This particular website puts you in street view at a random location in the world. I love to just see where I end up an explore the unknown location. Sometime you can be put into some pretty crazy places.</p>
