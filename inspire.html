        <h2>What makes a hero???????????</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we can look to when we are lost. Their words or actions should be things that inspire us to become a better version of ourselves. A true hero looks to help others in need.</p>
        <p>There are very few people who have accomplished more than Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was a seven time Mr. Olymipa, the biggest movie star in the world at one point, and also the governor of California. He was a man that had many missions in life and should be an inspiration to us all. </p>
